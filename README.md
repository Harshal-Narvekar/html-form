# html-form
This is the GitHub repository for all the steps on how to build an HTML registration form (FreeCodeCamp project).

You may wonder why I created a repository for this when you can just go to Freecodecamp.org and see all the steps. Well, the thing is, while I was developing this form, I wondered what if I knew the steps and created this form from scratch in VS Code. So that's what I did.

I created the Exact form in VS Code and pasted Codeacademy the steps in Word so I knew exactly what to paste and where in the FreeCodeCamp project.

I hope you like it and enjoy!
